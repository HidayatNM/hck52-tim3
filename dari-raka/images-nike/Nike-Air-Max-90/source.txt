Air Max 90

The '90s were a turning point in cultureâ€”art, music, fashion and sneakers. The Air Max was at the forefront of the movement. With even more exposed Air cushioning and a new colour affectionately dubbed as "Infrared", its revolutionised design helped the first 90 take on a life of its own. No longer just a running shoe, it solidified Air Max as a streetwear cornerstone.
